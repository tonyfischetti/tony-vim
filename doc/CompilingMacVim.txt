Compiling MacVim
----------------

I wanted lua support but I had trouble compiling vim with it
I wound up compiling lua myself and installing it to /usr/local
it didn't fix the problem, but I linked against it anyway.
It probably was unecessary


Download source code
git clone https://github.com/b4winckler/macvim.git

I had to change "luaL_optlong" in src/if_lua.c (line 777)
to "luaL_optinteger"



./configure "CC=clang"
    "CFLAGS=-O3 -I/usr/local/include -I/opt/local/include"
    "LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/lib -L/opt/local/lib"
    --with-features=huge
    --enable-fail-if-missing
    --enable-luainterp
    --with-lua-prefix=/usr/local/
    --enable-mzschemeinterp
    --enable-perlinterp
    --enable-python3interp
    --enable-tclinterp
    --enable-rubyinterp
    --enable-cscope
    --enable-multibyte
    --with-compiledby=Tony.Fischetti
    --with-macarchs=x86_64
    --with-tlib=ncurses
    --enable-gui=macvim
    --without-x
    --disable-gpm



The resulting app bundle will reside under `MacVim/build/Release`.  To try it
out quickly, type:

    $ open src/MacVim/build/Release/MacVim.app

To install MacVim, type

    $ open src/MacVim/build/Release

and drag the MacVim icon into your `Applications` folder.

and finallly:
sudo cp src/MacVim/mvim /usr/local/bin
